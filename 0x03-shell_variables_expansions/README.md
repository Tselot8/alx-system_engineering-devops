# 0x03 Shell Variables, Expansions, and Arithmetic

This repository contains a series of **Bash scripting exercises** designed to teach and reinforce the use of **variables, environment variables, arithmetic operations, and text processing** in a Linux shell environment. The exercises focus on practical tasks such as creating local and global variables, performing mathematical operations, converting numbers between bases, formatting floating-point numbers, and generating combinations.

Each script is written in a simple, **readable Bash style**, following best practices for scripting, and demonstrates how environment variables interact with shell arithmetic and expansions. The tasks range from basic variable assignment to more advanced operations like exponentiation, binary-to-decimal conversion, and generating ordered combinations.

These exercises are ideal for learners looking to strengthen their understanding of **shell scripting fundamentals**, develop problem-solving skills in the shell, and prepare for real-world automation and scripting tasks in Linux environments.
